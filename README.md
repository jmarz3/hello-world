# hello-world
intializing repository for GitHub

Hello all. I am very new to programming and am in the process of learning java. I have set up this GitHub account as I have been advised that as I progress it's use will become increasingly invaluable as I mature as a programmer/developer,so here I am.

Went dormant for a spell, now back. . .until I go dormant again.
